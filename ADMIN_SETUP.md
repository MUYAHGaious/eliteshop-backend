# üîê Admin Panel Setup Guide

## Overview
This updated version of EliteShop includes a secure admin panel with authentication. Users no longer need to create accounts - the system is designed for guest checkout only.

## Admin Access

## Production Security Notes

### Important: Change Default Credentials
Before deploying to production, create a new admin user:

1. Access your production database
2. Update the admin password:
   ```python
   from src.models.admin import Admin
   admin = Admin.query.filter_by(username='admin').first()
   admin.set_password('your-secure-password')
   db.session.commit()
   ```

### Environment Variables
Set these in your production environment:
- `SECRET_KEY` - Strong secret key for session security
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

### Additional Security Recommendations
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Consider adding two-factor authentication
- Regular security audits and updates

## Troubleshooting

### Admin Can't Login
1. Check if admin user exists in database
2. Verify password is correct
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure cookies are enabled

### Session Issues
1. Clear browser cookies and localStorage
2. Check CORS configuration
3. Verify `supports_credentials=True` in Flask-CORS

### Database Issues
1. Ensure admin table is created
2. Check database connectivity
3. Verify admin user exists with correct credentials
